# Research-datasets
This repository contains the input datasets required for predicting waterlogging susceptibility of urban roads, with detailed information provided in the README.
1. The excel file ‘Storm-waterlogging points in the study area.xlsx’ stores the coordinates of the collected waterlogging points in the study area in the coordinate system GCS_WGS_1984. ArcGIS 10.7 was used to digitise the data.
2. The folder ‘Road network’ stores the road data used in this study, in vector .shp format.
